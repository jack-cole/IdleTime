# IdleTime

This is a Python script that runs LOCALLY (if you try to run it remotely, you're gonna get a lot of lag) on a server with Teamspeak. It will append the time someone's been idle (not speaking, changing channels, or doing anything in Teamspeak) next to someone's name. This is helpful when you have a server full of people who leave their Teamspeak on while they do something else, and is a great alternative to moving people out of channels, which can be quite distracting to other people.

## Requirements

* Perl
	* Suggested: Perl 5.2 or later
* Server running Teamspeak that you can execute Perl scripts on


## Installation

1. Get your ServerQuery login information
2. Rename *Example_idletime.cfg* to *idletime.cfg*
3. Open *idletime.cfg* and set the values. There's comments on everything inside.
4. Run *idletime.pl* with Perl
